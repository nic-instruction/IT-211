        "Arrays allow us to process a lot more data than the basic datatypes, and they let us keep metadata about ordered groups of things.  They also have a number of methods that can be used on them to sort, order, and organize them.  Strings with something seperating data (:, space, | are all common) can be easily turned into String arrays as well.\n",

        "* if you print an array it will print the type and its address in memory, not the contents\n",
        "* You can loop through an array to actually copy it to another array, or use double[] b = Arrays.copyOf(a, 3); where 3 is the number of elements you want to copy, so you can also copy part of an array\n",
        "* arrayName.lenth gives you the number of elements in an array, note this is not a method like string.length(), it is a constant.\n",
        "* enhanced for loop (for each loop) `for (int value : values) {    System.out.println(value);}`\n",
        "* Note: enhanced for loops expose the value of the array member directly, so there's no insight into the index/position of the value in the array.\n",

        "# The Arrays class\n",
        "* The Arrays class provides many other useful methods like Arrays.compare, Arrays.equals, Arrays.fill, and Arrays.sort. Take a moment to read the documentation by searching the web for java.util.Arrays.\n",

We could just as easily split on `|` or `:` both of which are fairly common delimiters.\n",
