        "   * You can run all the code at once without having to run every single class by using \"Run All\" in the menu above: **Runtime > Run All**.  This will make sure your latest changes are written to the filesystem.\n",
        "   * If you've only modified one class, and your error is being reported in another class, don't change anything in your other class.  If you need to reset to a baseline, comment out your code, and copy over a fresh copy of the relevent method from https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2/tree/master/ch14 .\n",
