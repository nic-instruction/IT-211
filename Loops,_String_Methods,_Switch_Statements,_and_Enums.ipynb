        "* Say you want to do the same thing for every word in a sentance?  A loop can do this very quickly without error.\n",
        "* When you combine loops with If statements, that's where things get really powerful.  You can write code to analize each number in a range, or word in a sentance, or word in a giant text file and then use if statements to do different things, depending on what the word or number is.\n",
        "* Loops are the workhorses of code.  You can even do loops within loops, which are called nested loops!\n",
        "* ***History: Loops were a concept used long before computers were around to program, but the first person to use a software loop was Ada Lovelace (mathmatician), commonly known by her maiden name - Byron, while calculating Bernoulli numbers, back in the 19th century.  Ada invented programming on the first known theoretical \"Turing Machine\" designed by Charles Babage.  It was never constructed in his lifetime, but Ada understood Babbage's Analytical Engine well enough to extend its capabilities and inventing programming.***"
