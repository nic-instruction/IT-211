        "# Inheritance in Java\n",
        "Now that we understand how to build basic classes, we can talk about inheritance which is a huge part of object oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows us to 'extend' a class, in other words, add new features to existing code, in a way that changes its functionality, without having to alter the existing code, or rewrite it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is super useful for a number of reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You don't have to rewrite code, your child class just inherits functionality from the parent class.\n",
        "2. If one of the inherited attributes or methods doesn't work for your class, you can just overwrite it with your own version.  The version in your child class always takes president over the inherited method or attribute.\n",
        "3. Objects remain isolated from each other, but can share functionality and become linked.\n",
        "\n",
